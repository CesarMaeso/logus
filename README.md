5. Click on the 'Activate' button to use your new theme right away.
6. Navigate to Appearance > Customize in your admin panel and customize to taste.
7. It is highly recommend that you install Logus Toolbox Plugin (Require PHP 5.4).


== Important Notes ==

The header sidebar area is only visible on the front page and it is designed to add the "Logus - Menu de Redes Sociales" widget. You can add any widget although it is not recommended.

The theme is responsive based on Foundation framework and by default it displays a simplified front page on mobile phones and tablets.

* At 1024px width, the main menu toogle to Foundation off-canvas mobile pattern.
* At 640px width, only the title will be shown, home sidebar and sidebar are hidden.

I recommend a short site title and max 3 or 4 header menu items for the logo, title and menu to align properly. 

Social Menu. (Logus - Menu de Redes Sociales)

In order to display your social icons in a sidebar, all you need to do is:

1. Go to Appearance > Menus and create a menu containing links to your social profiles. (twitter, facebook, github, instagram, skype, vimeo and youtube).
2. Add Widget "Logus - Menu de Redes sociales" to any sidebar area and select the new menu.
